# Tempytron code
A continuous time (semi-analytic!) implementation of single and multi spike tempotron learning algorithms. 
## tempytron_main.py
Parses options and runs one of a set of classifer & learning algorithm combinations using the codebase stored in `tempytron_lib.py`.

## tempytron_lib.py
Contains function definitions.

## tempytron_validation.ipynb 
a jupyter/ipython notebook showing the validation of the model and eligibilities using a numerical implementation whose functions are explicitly defined in this file.
